Here are 3 features that I have added to this project:

1. Donation System: I have implemented a donation system where users can donate to various causes or initiatives. Users can view donation items, add them to their donation list.

2. Search Functionality: I have added search functionality to allow users to filter donation items based on category names such as health, education, clothing, or food. Users can input a category name, click the search button, and view only the matching category items.

3. Donation Statistics: I have included a statistics page that displays a pie chart representing the total donation array index length and the localstorage donation array length. This feature provides users with a visual representation of total donation and your donation.
